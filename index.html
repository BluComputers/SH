            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website! The home of <strong>Bo and Obs</strong>! And also the rest of my poetry.</p>
            <p>I started writing after my mum died really as grief therapy. Looking after my dad through the day and writing at night. I write about anything that happens to drop into my head so maybe here you'll find something that strikes a chord.</p>
            <p>I want my poems to be available to anyone so if you do see one you'd like to use for any occasion there's no need to ask me. Here and now I give my blessing. Just dont say you wrote it!! Thanks for dropping by.</p>
            <p><strong>Love Sarah H ❤️</strong></p>

            moon: { title: "The Moon Story", text: `"Grandad! Grandad! tell us the moon story!\nTell us about your dad in the war\nWe know we,ve heard it many times\nBut please tell us just once more"\n\nWell I was six years old when war came\nUp to then I knew no pain or fear\nBut i remember the look on my fathers face\nAs he wiped away my mothers tears\n\nThat night as he sat on the edge of my bed\nWe both looked at the moon shining bright\nAnd we made a pact between father and son\nTo always remember that sight\n\n"Wherever this war takes me son\nJust remember we see the same sky\nAt bedtime each night look for moonlight\nAnd i promise the time will fly by"\n\nThe next day we went to the station\nTo wave our boys off on their way\nI felt out out of place as mother held him so tight\nTried to hold my own tears at bay\n\nAs the train pulled away he shot me a wink\n"Remember to look for the moon!"\nI waved till the last carriage was out of sight\nNow just hope that i,d see him again soon\n\nI held mothers hand as we trudged home that day\nBoth lost in our own thoughts and fears\nThe house seemed so empty without fathers laugh\nJust sadness , lonliness and tears\n\nMother gave me a picture of father to keep\nAnd i placed it at the side of my bed\nEach night as i prayed i held it close to my heart\nAnd remembered the words that he,d said\n\nThen before i finally turned out the light\nI,d look to the moon and make a wish\n"Bring them all safely back to us"\nSent on its way with a kiss\n\nI would hear mother crying herself to sleep\nI felt so helpless. We missed him so much\nI tried so hard to make her happy\nAll she wanted was father,s touch\n\nWeeks turned to months. Months to a year\nJust one letter to say he was well\nHe missed us and loved us so very much\nThe end of the war nobody could tell\n\nI missed his stories. I missed his laugh\nI longed to hear his voice again\nI wandered sometimes to the station\nBut he was never on the next train\n\nThe radio told us things were better\nHow the enemy was now on the run\nAnd mother seemed to be hopeful\nThat just maybe this war might be won\n\nI remember the last night so clearly\nSaid my prayers to the light of the moon\nClosed my eyes as tight as can be\nHoped i,d wake to a happier tune\n\nAnd then as the sun kissed me gently awake\nI looked out of my window to see\nA weary soldier slowly marching\nMarching home to me\n\nStill in pyjamas i ran down the lane\nHe dropped his bag and sank to one knee\nAnd i sobbed as i fell into his embrace\nAt last we were once again three\n\nAnd then for a while i stayed out of the way\nI played in the garden till late afternoon\nThen at bedtime a kiss from my father\nAnd we said thank you to our old friend the moon\n\nAs i drifted off to a peaceful sleep\nI heard my parents laughing together once more\nOur family complete. The story now told\nHow the moon brought father home from the war` },
            dec1914: { title: "December 1914", text: `Is anybody coming for me?\nIs this where my life will end?\nI,m only a lad. It,s not my time\nHappier days are just round the bend\n\nHow can you leave me here in this mud?\nWhen yesterday no bullets flew\nWe were friends for twenty four hours\nNow it means nothing to me or you\n\nTwo days ago the guns fell silent\nWe waited. Too scared to blink\nThe hours of nothing but stillness\nNot knowing just what to think\n\nThen suddenly the softest of voices\nA Christmas melody borne on the wind\nAn enemy choir, A serenade\nAll aggression suddenly dimmed\n\nAnd then with both arms aloft\nA single soldier came over the top\n"Frohe Weihnachten" he said in a nervous voice\n"Frohe Weihnachten for one day let,s stop"\n\nThen slowly his comrades began to appear\nArms raised. They meant us no harm\nWe did the same. We met in the middle\nThere were smiles. No cause for alarm\n\nThe officers saluted. A mutual respect\nHandshakes and cigarettes shared\nAnd photographs of our girls back home\nWe were all human, We all knew we cared\n\nI got some chocolate. Oh the heaven of it,s taste\nExchanged for a cigar or two\nConversation and laughter. A smile and a wink\nFriendships forged as we shared a brew\n\nThen out of the blue a ball appeared\nIn that instant the war was no more\nA football match for two hundred men\nNobody cared who won or what score\n\nWe ran till our hearts burst out of our chests\nNations aligned in the common goal\nThat day football brought us together\nNo enemies. Just a perfect collective soul\n\nAnd then at the dusk it was over\nWe shared a rum and bid them goodnight\nBack to our trench. Back to the stench\nBack to the pointless fight\n\nMorning came and over we went\nI felt bullets whizz past my ear\nYou dont have time to stop and think\nToo busy to feel any fear\n\nBut then you know. It burns so bad\nYou know when you,ve been hit\nAnd you lie there and hope they dont see you\nThe lads will fetch me back in a bit\n\nThe winter sky is grey and white\nThe snowflakes cover my face\nIt,s nearly time to say goodbye\nFor my soul to leave this place\n\nI,ll leave it in the knowledge\nThat there,s always another way\nI,ve made my peace with God and man\nOn this my dying day` },
            ukraine: { title: "For the children of Ukraine", text: `If I could ask you to paint me a picture\nYellow sun and sea of blue\nI'd proudly hang it on my wall\nAnd tell the world it was created by you\n\nIf I could walk through your fields and pick flowers\nButtercups of yellow and forget me not blue\nI'd make each and every one of you a posy\nBrighten your lives for a moment or two\n\nIf I could spend just a day in your company\nFrom the yellow dawn to the twilight of blue\nWe'd share stories and memories from happier times\nHopes and dreams for me and for you\n\nIf I could rebuild your houses\nI'd paint them in shades of yellow and blue\nBright colours for a brighter future\nA safe place for your light to shine through\n\nIf I could make a rainbow appear in your sky\nThe brightest colours would be yellow and blue\nShining for peace, shining for love\nThe start of a new life for you\n\nAnd one day I pray you will line the streets\nWaving your flags of yellow and blue\nWelcoming home your daddies\nAs they come marching home to you` },
